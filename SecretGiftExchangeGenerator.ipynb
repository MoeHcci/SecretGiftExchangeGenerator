    "- Given a file of participants, \n",
    "- Each participant should be randomly assigned another participant to get a gift for. \n",
    "- A participant should not be assigned to get themselves a gift,and additionally it should be possible to predefine some assignments that are not allowed. \n",
    "- A secret gift exchange generator would probably notify the participants of their assignment by email, but for this purpose there is no need to actually send an email. In place of that you can just have a print statement that is something like \"Notifying asa@vitalbio.com that he is assigned to get a gift for Leah Skerl\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preferred submission format is a github link to a repo with the files in it that we need along with a README that describes your approach and how to run it"
